#Automl_Evalml Experiments for Market segmentation:
What is EvalML?
EvalML cuts down the process of model training and tuning by hand, this includes data quality checks and cross-validation.
Data Checks and warnings: EvalML helps you in identifying the problem in the data before using or setting it up for modelling.
Pipeline building: EvalML helps you in constructing a highly optimized pipeline including state-of-the-art data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, and a lot of modelling techniques.
Model Understanding: Just like Shap, Eli5, Lime, and other model explainability libraries EvalML also provides a broad level of understanding about the model you are building, for the purpose of presentation.
Domain-specific: This is the missing link in most of the AutoML libraries where you can define the objective of the problem. Once you have determined the objective for your business, you can provide that to EvalML to optimize by defining a custom objective function.
